# CSC227 Operating Systems: CPU Scheduler Simulator

This project is a Java-based simulation of a single-CPU scheduling system, developed for the CSC227 Operating Systems course. The primary objective is to implement and compare three different CPU scheduling algorithms using multithreading to manage processes. The source code lives under the `simulator.*` package hierarchy, and matching documentation is available in the `doc/` directory.

## üìã Project Overview

The simulator reads process information from an external file (`job.txt`), loads them into a ready queue based on memory availability, and executes them according to a user-selected scheduling algorithm. It then calculates and displays performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

- **Three Scheduling Algorithms**:

  - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: A non-preemptive algorithm that selects the process with the smallest burst time.
  - **Round-Robin (RR)**: A preemptive algorithm with a time quantum of **7ms**.
  - **Priority Scheduling**: A non-preemptive algorithm where a higher number indicates a higher priority (1 = Lowest, 128 = Highest).

- **Multithreading**: The application utilizes multiple threads for concurrent operations:

  - **File Reader Thread**: An independent thread that reads process data from `job.txt`, creates a Process Control Block (PCB) for each, and places them in the job queue.
  - **Process Loader Thread**: A thread that continuously monitors memory and moves processes from the job queue to the ready queue if sufficient memory is available.
  - **Main Thread**: Responsible for running the chosen scheduling algorithm.

- **Memory Management**: Simulates a main memory of **2048 MB**. A process is only loaded into the ready queue if there's enough space for it.

- **Starvation Handling**: For the Priority Scheduling algorithm, the simulator detects and resolves starvation using an **aging** technique.

- **System Call Simulation**: The program proposes and simulates a set of system calls for process control, memory management, and information maintenance.

## üìå Assumptions & Constraints

- All jobs arrive at time 0; ordering in `job.txt` defines dispatch tie-breakers.
- `job.txt` may list at most 30 jobs, and their combined memory requirement must not exceed **2048 MB**.
- Context switching time is treated as zero.
- The simulator always runs with the reader and loader threads in addition to the main scheduling thread.
- Aging in priority scheduling increases dynamic priority every five time units spent waiting (up to priority 128).

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites**:

    - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

2.  **Compilation**:

    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the project root (`CSC227-OS-Project`).
    - Compile all sources into the `out/` directory (create it first if needed). Two common approaches:

      **macOS/Linux**

      ```bash
      find simulator -name "*.java" > sources.txt
      javac -d out @sources.txt
      ```

      **Windows PowerShell**

      ```powershell
      Get-ChildItem -Recurse simulator -Filter *.java | ForEach-Object FullName > sources.txt
      javac -d out @sources.txt
      ```

      After compiling you can remove `sources.txt` if you no longer need it.

3.  **Execution**:
    - Ensure `job.txt` is present alongside the compiled classes.
    - Run the simulator entry point:
      ```bash
      java -cp out simulator.app.Main
      ```
    - The program will prompt you to choose a scheduling algorithm interactively.

## üìÅ Input File Format (`job.txt`)

The program reads process data from a file named `job.txt`. Each line in the file represents a single job and must follow this format:

`Process_ID:Burst_Time_ms:Priority;Memory_Required_MB`

**Example `job.txt`:**

```
1:25:4;500
2:13:3;700
3:20:3;100
```

## üìä Expected Output

The program will:

1.  Display a step-by-step execution trace for the selected algorithm, preferably as a **Gantt chart**.
2.  Show the start and end times for each process.
3.  For Priority scheduling, it will indicate if any process suffered from starvation.
4.  Finally, it will print a comparison of the **average waiting time** and **average turnaround time** for all jobs.
